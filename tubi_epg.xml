Whether they’re breaking ice on Green Bay to chase trophy walleye or traveling up to the Northwoods to carry on years of family traditions, Kaitlin and Josh Woodward embody a passion for fishing in its truest form. After fishing together for nearly 11 years, the Woodwards started a part-time guiding business in 2019 called Woodward Fishing to share their passion for their own Wisconsin waters. Some of Kaitlin’s favorite memories on the water have been in Green Bay chasing trophy fish; she recounts, “Every cast was a pre-spawn 25” -27” walleye; it was unreal.” Their teamwork and drive on the water are unmatched. Josh brings his determination to find the fish, and Kaitlin brings her tenacity and ability to get everyone back to the purity of nature no matter what the day brings.They have guided together for the past four years in the Northwoods of Wisconsin and Green Bay, and both areas hold an equally special place for the Woodwards. Josh cut his teeth fishing in Green Bay and Sturgeon Bay with his grandfather and grew up going to the Northwoods with his family. These traditions have become a way of life for Josh and Kaitlin as their year revolves around making the most of the season in both locations with their favorite boat dog, Kimber, in tow. “My family was here before my time, and now we’re going to pass that on to our kids.” – Josh WoodwardFollow their adventures as they put AFTCO fishing rain gear to the test in our newest AFTCO Original Film, “Up North.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250612060030 +0000" stop="20250612063026 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>The SJTV crew head to famous Lake Vermilion in Northern Minnesota to chase after the fabled Muskies at Everett Bay Lodge!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250612063026 +0000" stop="20250612070022 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>Tyler and Sara pitch leeches for shallow water walleyes in tough conditions.

Whether they’re breaking ice on Green Bay to chase trophy walleye or traveling up to the Northwoods to carry on years of family traditions, Kaitlin and Josh Woodward embody a passion for fishing in its truest form. After fishing together for nearly 11 years, the Woodwards started a part-time guiding business in 2019 called Woodward Fishing to share their passion for their own Wisconsin waters. Some of Kaitlin’s favorite memories on the water have been in Green Bay chasing trophy fish; she recounts, “Every cast was a pre-spawn 25” -27” walleye; it was unreal.” Their teamwork and drive on the water are unmatched. Josh brings his determination to find the fish, and Kaitlin brings her tenacity and ability to get everyone back to the purity of nature no matter what the day brings.They have guided together for the past four years in the Northwoods of Wisconsin and Green Bay, and both areas hold an equally special place for the Woodwards. Josh cut his teeth fishing in Green Bay and Sturgeon Bay with his grandfather and grew up going to the Northwoods with his family. These traditions have become a way of life for Josh and Kaitlin as their year revolves around making the most of the season in both locations with their favorite boat dog, Kimber, in tow. “My family was here before my time, and now we’re going to pass that on to our kids.” – Josh WoodwardFollow their adventures as they put AFTCO fishing rain gear to the test in our newest AFTCO Original Film, “Up North.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250612060030 +0000" stop="20250612063026 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>The SJTV crew head to famous Lake Vermilion in Northern Minnesota to chase after the fabled Muskies at Everett Bay Lodge!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250612063026 +0000" stop="20250612070022 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>Tyler and Sara pitch leeches for shallow water walleyes in tough conditions.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250612221700 +0000" stop="20250612230900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Starkville, Mississippi to try to rescue the failing Hotel Chester.

With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.

The appointments secretary to the Governor had carried on an illicit affair with a wealthy married man.  Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the woman's body or the murder weapon.  The FBI's only hope was to go undercover, and turn brother against brother.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250612220100 +0000" stop="20250612225700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1986, a small crime free Indiana town was turned inside out by the arrival of one dangerous stranger. After an officer was gunned down at point-blank range, the psychotic killer led investigators across the Midwest. No one knew where the gunman would strike next, even as his tally of murders and abductions grew. The FBI and state police raced against time to rescue America's heartland from this deranged gunman, before he killed again.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250612225700 +0000" stop="20250612235400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A young mother and her infant son mysteriously disappeared from their home.  The woman's husband was the only suspect, but he was eventually cleared. There was no solid evidence that a crime had even been committed.  Six months later, a local farmer found the remains of the missing woman and her child.  Both had been murdered.  Agents and local police had only one tiny piece of evidence, an unidentified hair found in the murdered woman's car.  The hair was too small for analysis.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250612235400 +0000" stop="20250613005200 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A stranger snatched an eight-year-old girl as she played in her Tucson, Arizona neighborhood, leaving behind an abandoned bicycle and a frantic mother.  Hundreds of citizens and police officers fanned out across the region, hoping to find some trace of the young girl or her abductor.  Within hours, a suspect emerged; a drifter who was out on parole for abducting and molesting children.

While some of the villagers - such as Ernest's daughter Isolde - believe that powerful magical forces are at play, others think the reasons for the bloodshed may have their roots in the distant past. Barnaby and Jones soon find themselves delving into the occult, magic, and ancients books of power, to determine what happened, and soon sense a mixture of both might be the motive for the murder, when a book shop owner is killed with shattered glass, laced in the same poison.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250611080000 +0000" stop="20250611100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are forced to take part in a team building exercise and Tom has plenty of problems dealing with the young, new, acting Chief Superintendent, John Cotton (Nick Fletcher).
